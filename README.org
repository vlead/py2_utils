* Release Notes for v0.2.0

=py2_utils= implements tasks related to paths, urls and
tasks. 

This version defines =sh_utils/task_funs.py= to define shell
(system) tasks.  Each function takes arguments and performs
system commands.  These functions themselves do not use task
objects.  (That's for a future version).
