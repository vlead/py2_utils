* Release Notes for v1.0.0

=py2_utils= implements utilities for paths, urls, types, and
now workflows:

 - =path_utils= :: various functions, predicates, and checks
                   on paths. 

 - =sh_utils= :: various shell based tasks.

 - =type_utils= :: Various definitions of Types and Checks

 - =url_utils= :: Predicates and checks on urls

 - =wf= :: Workflow system based on jobs and task functions (funs)



 







* Release Notes for v0.2.0

=py2_utils= implements tasks related to paths, urls and
tasks. 

This version defines =sh_utils/task_funs.py= to define shell
(system) tasks.  Each function takes arguments and performs
system commands.  These functions themselves do not use task
objects.  (That's for a future version).
